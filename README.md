# Frozen Code ðŸ¥¶
## The article I'll be talking about is the [Artic Code Vault](https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/#:~:text=The%20GitHub%20Arctic%20Code%20Vault,Pole%20than%20the%20Arctic%20Circle.).

I'm revisiting this article because I had heard about the Arctic Code Vault, but never really read into it just because I had zero idea of how GitHub worked at the time. Looking at it from what I know now, I find this effort to collect humanity's knowledge up until 2/2/2020 beyond fascinating. First and foremost, it makes me think about how we've chosen to archive what we know and how we've shared it in past years. The first thing that comes to mind is Carl Sagan's Golden Disc, released into space for any extra-terrestrial life to find and learn about the culture and diversity on earth. Although the vault is more likely to be used locally, I really admire the efforts made to preserve such important artifacts from Earth.

It also makes me wonder how history can be seen through these archives throughout the year. How can the code we've written throuhgout history change our perspective about world events. Or even more interestingly, can the code we've written reveal information about our history that we don't know yet. What patterns does it show? Does it reveal anything about issues that technology has prioritized? I would be really interesting to see the repos from the beginning of COVID-19 and see how much progress was made since.
